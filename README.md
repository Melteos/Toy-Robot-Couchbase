# Toy-Robot-Couchbase

*This is an refactoring assignment given by Trendyol Tech Team during the Kodluyoruz Trendyol Tech Talent Bootcamp.*

The original [project](https://gitlab.com/molgun/toy-robot) contains toy robot project with 3 different data source implementations. 

This bonus assignment was to refactor the domain so that Rover class' methods move, turnRight and turnLeft would not use many if else statements.

Other functionalities still work as before (Database operations, passing the tests,..)

Refactoring is done on the **branch couchbase.**
